# Generic-Calculator

Coded the generic calculator which can calculate integer, floating values and even their combination

Designed a generic calculator that
takes as input an expression and evaluates as outputs
the answer.

For this, I have coded `generic stack`

`Generic stack` = A single expression can
contain both int,double and the answer should be
accordingly.

Example: 

1. Input : (4+5)/6*3
Output : 4.5

2. Input: (4+5.6)/3.2+(4+3.888) Output: 10.888
